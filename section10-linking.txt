andriod project options, linker properties
the linker evaluates if refernced assemblies are being used in the xamarin project or not.
if not they wont be included in the package.
None:
turns off the linker "largest size"
SDK Assemblies only:
evaluates assemblies from xamarin. android "smaller"
SDK and user Assemblies:
evaluates all "the smallest"

what if some code was being evaluated as not refernced but I want it there
use attributes, you can see that in the contacts class

this you might need for :
-You might have code that you call dynamically via System.Reflection.MemberInfo.Invoke.
- If you instantiate types dynamically, you may want to preserve the default constructor of your types.
- If you use XML serialization, you may want to preserve the properties of your types.
