we use app center to :
- know if,when and why the app crashes
- know the type of devices the users use, how many times the app is opened and similar analytics
- track amount of user logins, button presses or errors in the app without crashing

must use shared runtime when debugging on the emulator and remove it before downloading a build on actual phone using app center
