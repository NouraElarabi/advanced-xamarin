Prism: make the VM implement IPageLifecycleAware -> OnAppearing , OnDisappearing

5- add functionality to when and item from the list view is selected
No Prism: in the view .cs file "code behind" as this is an event, or bind to the selected item and use set
Prism: use the prism behavior -> EventToCommandBehavior


6- passing a parameter while navigating
No Prism: "code behind" make a constructor in the view.xaml.cs file that takes the parameter, inside that get the vm from the resources, set a variable in the vm to that parameter, now send the parameter in the new view(param) in the navigation function
Prism: "in the vm" use INavigatedAware in the view VM, and navigate to this page using NavigationParameters
